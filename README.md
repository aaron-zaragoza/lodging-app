# Lodging App
This app was inspired by the popular travel and booking website: Airbnb. 
Sites and descriptions have been hard-coded, but show some of the robust features provided in the React framework and libraries within.

# Technologies
Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, Material-UI

# Challenges
I noticed that Airbnb recently announced the release of an API and I was hoping to request data to dynamically update listings; however, it appears that this is not available for production and I opted to hard-code the listings.

# Moving Forward
Once Airbnb's API allows developers to render data, I plan to request data for dynamic camping homestays and update the theme of this app to accurately reflect the type of locations being pulled from the API.
